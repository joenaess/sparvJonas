# Språkbanken's Sparv Pipeline

![](../images/sparv_detailed.png){ align=right .intro-logo }
The Sparv Pipeline is a powerful command line tool designed for annotating text with a wide range of linguistic
annotations. Developed by [Språkbanken Text](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/), Sparv provides a comprehensive solution for
text analysis, supporting various source formats, annotations, and export formats.

Sparv comes equipped with numerous modules that facilitate the entire workflow from importing text data, annotating it
with linguistic features, exporting the results in different formats, to deploying the annotated corpus. Its modular
architecture allows for easy extension through plugins, enabling support for additional external tools and custom
annotations as needed.

While Sparv is primarily designed for Swedish text, it can also be used for other languages. Writing plugins to
integrate third-party tools that support other languages is straightforward, making Sparv a flexible solution for
multilingual text analysis.

With Sparv, you can streamline your text annotation process with a single command, making it an efficient and versatile
tool for linguistic research and text analysis.

# General Concepts
This section will give a brief overview of how Sparv modules work and introduce some general concepts. More details are
provided in the following chapters.

The Sparv Pipeline is comprised of some core functionality and many different modules containing Sparv functions that
serve different purposes like reading and parsing source files, building or downloading models, producing
annotations and producing output files that contain the source text and annotations. All of these modules (i.e. the
code inside the `sparv/modules` directory) are replacable. A Sparv function is decorated with a special
[decorator](developers-guide/sparv-decorators) that tells Sparv what purpose it serves. A function's parameters hold
information about what input is needed in order to run the function and what output is produced by it. The Sparv core
automatically finds all decorated functions, scans their parameters and builds a registry for what modules are available
and how they depend on each other.


## Annotations
The most common Sparv function is the [annotator](developers-guide/sparv-decorators#annotator) which produces one or
more annotations. An annotation consists of spans that hold information about what text positions it covers and an
optional attribute for each span. For example, a function that segments a text into tokens produces a span annotation
that tells us where each token begins and ends in the source text. A function that produces part-of-speech tags on the
other hand would rely on the token spans produced by another function and just add an attribute for each token span,
telling us whether this token is a noun or a verb or something else.

Annotations are referred to by their internal names which follow a strict naming syntax. The name of a span annotation
starts with the name of the module that it is produced by, followed by a dot, followed by an arbitrary name consisting
of lowercase ASCII letters and underscores. The token span annotation produced by the `segment` module for example is
called `segment.token`. The name of an attribute annotation follows the same rules, except that it is prefixed with the
name of the span annotation that it is adding attributes to, and a colon. So the part-of-speech annotation produced by
the `stanza` module is called `segment.token:stanza.pos` because it adds part-of-speech attributes to the
`segment.token` span annotation.


## Dependencies
Some Sparv functions may require annotations from other functions before they can be run. These dependencies are
expressed in the function arguments. By using special [Sparv classes](developers-guide/sparv-classes) as default
arguments in a function's signature the central Sparv registry can automatically keep track of what annotations can be
produced by what function and in what order things need to be run. These dependencies can either be described in a
module specific manner or in a more abstact way. For example, an annotator producing word base forms (or lemmas) may
depend on a part-of-speech annotation with a specific tagset and therefore this annotator might define that its input
needs to be an annotation produced by a specific module. A part-of-speech tagger on the other hand usually needs word
segments as input, and it probably does not matter exactly what module produces these segments. In this case the
dependency can be expressed with an abstract [annotation class](#annotation-classes).


## Annotation Classes
When describing dependencies to other annotations one can make use of annotation classes which are denoted by angle
brackets (e.g. `<token>`, `<token:word>`). Annotation classes are used to create abstract instances for common
annotations such as tokens, sentences and text units. They simplify dependencies between annotation modules and increase
the flexibility of the annotation pipeline. Many annotation modules need tokenised text as input, but they might not
care about what tokeniser is being used. So instead of telling a module that it needs tokens produced by another
specific module we can tell it to take the class `<token>` as input. In the [corpus
configuration](user-manual/corpus-configuration.md) we can then set `classes.token` to `segment.token` which tells Sparv
that `<token>` refers to output produced by the `segment` module.

Annotation classes are valid across all modules and may be used wherever you see fit. There is no closed set of
annotation classes and each module can invent its own classes if desired. Within a corpus directory all existing classes
can be listed with the `sparv classes` command.
